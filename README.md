# World-Meningities-Day---Advocacy-and-Engagement-on-Power-BI


Yesterday was #world #meningitis #day and I decided to get a data from kaggle for the analysis on Power BI.

The dashboard contained information on the gender of patients with Meningitis and also the mortality report of said patients.

Meningitis is an inflammation of brain and spinal cord membranes, typically caused by infection. It is one predominant infectious diseases. From the data Nigeria had more female Meningitis patient while adults were twice that of children.

Information about Meningitis in Nigeria is quite scarce and it will be interesting to have more to work with.
The dashboard shows the preponderance of those affected by the infectious disease are of rural settlements although this is very close to those urban settlements in Nigeria from 2010 to 2018.
The reported Meningitis cases were reconfirmed and about 50.3% were unconfirmed at the moment of writing this report, while 49.7 were confirmed. 
The heat map displayed areas of intensity of Meningitis in states in Nigeria. Benue had the highest case of meningitis at 849, followed by Ebonyi and Federal Capital Territory. Kwara had the lowest cases meningitis at 691.

The home page of the report containing information on mortality. Age group and serotype. While the detail or location page contains information about the states in Nigeria with degree of meningitis cases and further to show the confirmation report on the cases reported.

DISCLAIMER: I still doubt the credibility of the data and will encourage agencies and government to push for better documentation of health activities in Nigeria in the open space.
